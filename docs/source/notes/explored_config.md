# Favored Configuration

<img src="../imgs/todo-icon.jpeg" height="30px"> We will add the commonly used configuration of delta models HERE in future.

E.g.
- the modified_modules (position of delta), 
- hyperparameter that are the most efficient
- the favored composition between delta models

Currenlty, use the default setting, explore it by yourself, or refer to existing papers' configuration!
